# OS Deploy

I started OSDeploy.com as a way for me to document several of the things that I do related to deploying Windows for a large Enterprise.  Hopefully it will help others.  I'll be working with [Maik Koster](http://maikkoster.com/) on making some improvements in the near future.

Feel free to download a PDF of OSDeploy at [https://www.gitbook.com/download/pdf/book/segura/osdeploy](https://www.gitbook.com/download/pdf/book/segura/osdeploy)
