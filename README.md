# Windows 10 OS Deployment

**This GitBook is currently Under Construction.  Many things are incomplete, with a target date of January 2018 for the completed guide.**

We are not Consultants trying to sell you anything, just two guys that manage the OS Deployment of Windows 7 and Windows 10 for a large Enterprise.  OSDeploy is a way for us to document our steps and to share what we have learned.  Many things added here were compiled from others that we have decided to put together in a concise format.  If you feel there is something that needs to be explained or added, please feel free to reach out to us.
