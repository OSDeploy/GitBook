# Windows 10 OS Deployment

**This site is currently being built, check back in February 2018!**

We are not Consultants trying to sell you anything, just two guys that manage the OS Deployment of Windows 7 and Windows 10 for a large Enterprise.  OSDeploy is a way for us to document our steps and to share what we have learned.  Many things added here were compiled from others that we have decided to put together in a concise format.  If you feel there is something that needs to be explained or added, please feel free to reach out to us.
