# Provisioning Packages

You can easily convert OSConfig into a Provisioning Package for Windows 10 once you have all your settings complete.

Before getting started, you will need to install Windows Imaging Configuration Designer \(WICD or Windows ICD\).  This is a component of the Windows ADK so get this installed before getting started.

You will also need to create CAB files when creating Provisioning Packages.  You can easily make one using the [OSDeploy PowerShell Module](../../downloads/osdeploy-powershell-module.md)
