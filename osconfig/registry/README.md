# Registry

Working with the Registry is probably the most important things about customizing Windows.  Everybody does it, and there are many different ways to do it.

Most resources you will find typically add Registry entries from the command line \(Reg Add\), others import a REG file, or run a CMD or PS1 script.  The next few pages will focus on neither of these methods, instead focusing on RegistryXML.
