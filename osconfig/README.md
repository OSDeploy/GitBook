# Overview

OSConfig is a **method** of applying Operating System configuration during a Windows Deployment in One Step, without having multiple steps in your Task Sequence.  This allows for **simple** configuration that is **independent** of a Task Sequence.

### OSConfig Usage

OSConfig can be used in all types of Windows OS Deployments including MDT, ConfigMgr, and Stand-Alone for both New Computers and Upgrades \(Feature Updates\).  This feature makes this method of Operating System configuration **ideal**, as it is completely modular.  Unlike OSBuilder, OSConfig is not a module, and you are free to design whatever you can script without any limitations.

The OSConfig method has been tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10, and should work without issue on Windows Server deployments.
