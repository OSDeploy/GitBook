# MDT Deployment Share

The fastest way to setup, customize, and test OSConfig is by creating an MDT Deployment Share on your computer and testing with Hyper-V.

Remember this is "Development", not "Production".  Don't try to use an existing MDT Share

You will need to update the Deployment Share to create the Boot Image
