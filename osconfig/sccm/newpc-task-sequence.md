# New PC Task Sequence

Adding OSConfig to a New PC Task Sequence is done in three Run Command Line steps.  In the Setup Operating System phase, immediately after Setup Windows and Configuration Manager, create a New Group called OSConfig.

### OSConfig Remove Existing

While this step is not really required for a New PC Task Sequence, this will maintain consistency with Upgrade Task Sequences.  Under the Options tab, check the Continue on error.  Enter the following in the Command line

```
cmd /c rd %ProgramData%\OSConfig /S /Q
```

### OSConfig Apply Package

Another Run Command Line step is all it takes to copy the Package Content to C:\ProgramData\OSConfig

```
cmd.exe /c md %ProgramData%\OSConfig & cmd.exe /c xcopy ".\*" %ProgramData%\OSConfig /y /e
```

### OSConfig Execution

This is the final Command Line to actually run OSConfig.

```
PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File %ProgramData%\OSConfig\OSConfig.ps1
```
