# Applications Directory

Any PowerShell script relating to modifying Applications should go in here.  This is typically a script to remove unnecessary Windows 10 AppxPackages.
 a directory under OSConfig called Applications.  This is where you should place scripts for working with Applications.  Hopefully you should have your own PowerShell script to remove what you need, or just edit the one I have at the bottom of this page.
