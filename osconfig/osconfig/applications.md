# Applications Directory

Creating your own scripts in the Applications Container

By now you should have your own PowerShell script to remove Appx Packages. We run into some complication when trying to remove them AFTER the User Profile is created, including in ALL USERS. Why not remove them before the OS is even loaded?

Create a directory under OSConfig called Applications.  This is where you should place scripts for working with Applications.  Hopefully you should have your own PowerShell script to remove what you need, or just edit the one I have at the bottom of this page.
