# Downloads

There are multiple parts to OSConfig and they will be detailed separately.  The main download of OSConfig is a pre-configured Repository with changes to the Start Layout, Local Policy, Preferences, App Associations, and Appx Packages.

I felt that it was easier to release everything as a "Complete Package" and let you customize the components individually.  This lets you see the whole design of OSConfig and how it works.
