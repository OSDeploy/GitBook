# Future Plans

Over the next few weeks, I will be adding more content to OSConfig.  You already have an idea on how to implement this with MDT.  Coming soon will be how to apply this as a Package in an OSD Task Sequence for New Computer deployments, and Upgrades.  I've tried to keep it simple, but you can actually do some more advanced customizations.  Best of all, everything you customize is all configured externally, without adding several steps to a Task Sequence, and everything is done properly through Local Policy instead of reg Hacks.

More to come ....
