# AWS Setup

You can download OSDrivers with PowerShell with a few steps. OSDrivers is hosted on Amazon AWS S3 and you will need to create an AWS Account in order to Download.

## Create an AWS Account

Create an AWS Account by completing the following.

**Using OSDrivers is Free, and the Amazon AWS Account is free as well. I will be hosting Driver CAB files on AWS and depending on the costs that I incur for your downloads, I cannot guarantee it will always remain Free. I will be looking for Sponsors if the costs become excessive, or it may be necessary for you to add Billing to your Amazon AWS.**

**Please limit your downloads to only what you need. Thanks!**

## Generate Access Keys

Once you have created your AWS Account, you can Generate Access Keys

Create New Access Key to generate an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key. Save these numbers!
