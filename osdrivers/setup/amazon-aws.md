# Amazon AWS Setup

I have Published an OSDrivers Dell Repository on Amazon AWS.  You are free to use this as an Sample, but you will need to have an AWS Account created for Authentication.  If you have OSDrivers.vbs, and prefer to build your own, you can skip this page.

**Using OSDrivers is Free, but the Sample OSDrivers Dell Repository has a Storage Cost that am covering for the time being.  I cannot guarantee it will always remain Free.  I will be looking for Sponsors if the costs become excessive, or it may be necessary for you to add Billing to your Amazon AWS.**

**Please limit your downloads to only what you need.  Thanks!**

## Generate Access Keys

Once you have created your AWS Account, you can Generate Access Keys

Create New Access Key to generate an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key.  Save these numbers!

## Install OSDriver PowerShell Module

OSDriver is my PowerShell Module hosted on [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/OSDriver).  You will need to open PowerShell as Administrator and make sure that your Script Execution Policy allows you to install the Module first

```
PS C:\> Install-Module -Name OSDriver
```

## Select OSDriver in PowerShell ISE

From PowerShell, to open ISE, enter the following command

```
PS C:\> ISE
```

Make sure you have View &gt; Show Command Add-on enabled.  Then enter OSDriver in the Name.  This should return all the OSDriver Scripts you can use.  Select Get-OSDriverDownloads and then press Show Details.
