## Import-OSMedia

{% page-ref page="../../basics/import-osmedia/" %}

Use **`Import-OSMedia`** to import all Windows Editions you plan to include.  Its best to sort by **EditionId** as some languages may have the Image Name spelled differently

This process will take about 5-10 minutes per OS, so give it some time.  When complete, all Operating System Languages will be imported into OSMedia.  Windows 10 en-US does not show a language by default

## Update-OSMedia \(Base Language Only\)

{% page-ref page="../../basics/update-osmedia/" %}

The Base Language OS will need to be updated with **`Update-OSMedia`**.  It is not necessary to update the additional Languages
