When you have your Task sorted out you can create your OSBuild.  Here is what the WinPE Language integration looks like

The OS integration will include the Language Packs and Language Features will be installed, and Language Sources will be added.  A new Lang.ini will be generated \(in Sources\).  The Lang.ini is also copied to WinSE \(Windows Setup\)

When complete, the new **OSBuild** will be created.  If you did not select a Custom Name, the Languages will be added to the default name.  Additionally an **OSBuild.json** file will be included which will contain the Task + Templates that were used to create the OSMedia
