# OSBuild MultiLang Test

Now time to test OSBuild MultiLang

## WinSE \(Windows Setup Environment\)

This boots just like the last OSBuild, select a WinSE Language

And then a Windows installation

No comment

Here is where things change.  I selected English \(United States\) but since this Language is in all Indexes, I am presented with a selection.  The Index without the Language is the one I should select because that is the one with en-US as the System UI

But let's say I choose French

Again, select the Image without the Language as this will be the French System UI

## Windows 10 Upgrade

Windows Upgrade from the ISO is similar, I can select any Image Index as they all contain fr-FR

But selecting Windows 10 Enterprise fr-FR is the only one that will let me perform an Upgrade

## The End

This guide has taken quite a bit of time, I hope you gain some knowledge from it.  Good luck!
