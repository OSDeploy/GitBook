# Legacy Operating Systems

**OSDBuilder** can Update **Windows 7 SP1** and **Windows Server 2012 R2** by using **`Update-OSMedia`**.  Creating a customized OS \(**OSBuild**\) is not supported, nor are there any plans to develop this in the future

{% hint style="danger" %}
**There are no long term plans to continue to support Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 in OSDBuilder**

**There are no plans to include support for any other Legacy Operating Systems**
{% endhint %}
