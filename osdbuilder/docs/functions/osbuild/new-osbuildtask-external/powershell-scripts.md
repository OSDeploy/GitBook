# PowerShell Scripts

There are thousands of customizations that can be added to a Windows Image, and it would be impossible for OSDBuilder to contain Parameters for all of these.  This is why New-OSBuild has the ability to execute PowerShell Scripts.

## Add a Script

You can easily add a Script to OSDBuilder by placing the PowerShell Script in the OSDBuilder\Content\Scripts directory

## New-OSBuildTask

Once a PowerShell Script has been added, you can create a [**`New-OSBuildTask`**](../new-osbuildtask/) and select the Scripts you want to include

## Edit an Existing New-OSBuildTask

If you know how to edit a JSON file, you can easily add a Script to an existing [**`New-OSBuildTask`**](../new-osbuildtask/)**\`\`**

## New-OSBuild -Execute

When executing the [**`New-OSBuild`**](../new-osbuild.md) with the Scripts in the Task, you should see the scripts executed in the PowerShell Console

## Sharing

If you find this useful, I would appreciate it if you could come up with a script for me to add!
