# OSMedia

## Definition

**OSMedia** is an abbreviation of **Operating System Media**.  **OSDBuilder** defines **OSMedia** as an **Operating System Media without customizations**.

An Operating System ISO downloaded from Microsoft MVLS or MSDN would be considered **OSMedia**.

Microsoft releases monthly Security Updates, and sometimes releases updated **OSMedia** with these monthly Security Updates included. **OSDBuilder** "mirrors" this process to create updated **OSMedia** through Offline Servicing. This is not considered a customization as there are no material changes to the Operating System itself.

A customized **OSMedia** with material changes to the Operating System itself is referred to as an **OSBuild**
