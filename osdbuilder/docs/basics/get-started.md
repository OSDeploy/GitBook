## Get-OSDBuilder

This simple command will get you started.  When using **Get-OSDBuilder** for the first time, it will automatically select **C:\OSDBuilder** as the **OSDBuilder Home.**  Directories will be automatically created when they are needed

## Get-OSDBuilder -SetPath C:\OSD

If this path doesn't work for you, then you can set the path to something else.  You can even use method  to change between different **OSDBuilder** instances \(one for Client and one for Server\)
