# Requirements

## Admin Rights

**OSDBuilder** requires Admin Rights in PowerShell as you will be mounting Windows Images for Offline Servicing.  This is a requirement of DISM

## Operating System Requirements \(Your Computer\)

The **OSDBuilder** PowerShell Module requires an OS Version of 10, which includes the following Operating Systems

* **Windows 10**
* **Windows Server 2016**
* **Windows Server 2019**

{% hint style="danger" %}
Using the **OSDBuilder** PowerShell Module on Windows 7 or Windows Server 2012 will only cause pain, grief, and sorrow
{% endhint %}

## Operating Systems for Offline Servicing

OSDBuilder will allow you to fully Update and Customize Windows 10, Server 2016, or Server 2019.  Windows 7 and Server 2012 can be Updated but not Customized

| **Operating System** | **Update** | **Customize** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Windows 7** | **YES** | **NO** |
| **Windows 10** | **YES** | **YES** |
| **Windows Server 2012 R2** | **YES** | **NO** |
| **Windows Server 2016** | **YES** | **YES** |
| **Windows Server 2019** | **YES** | **YES** |

## Hardware Requirements

Offline Servicing of an Operating System can take a considerable amount of time, especially on older releases. The process of Mounting a WIM, Applying a Cumulative Update, and performing DISM Image Cleanup will take as little as 30 minutes \(1809 x86\) on an Intel Core i7 computer with a SSD, to almost 2 hours \(1607 x64\) on the same system.

Since OSDBuilder will mount Windows Images, I strongly recommend that you do not have any running Anti-Virus scanning files ON ACCESS. McAfee will prevent the dismounting of images properly.

{% hint style="info" %}
**OSDBuilder works best on a stand alone Workstation Class computer.  An AntiVirus performing On Access Scanning will interfere with mounted Windows Images.  Alternatively, you can use a Virtual Machine as an alternate solution**
