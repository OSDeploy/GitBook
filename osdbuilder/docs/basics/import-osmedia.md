## Windows Media

You will need to Import an Operating System to use with **OSDBuilder**.  This must be done with the original DVD or a mounted ISO.  You can use any of the following Media

* \*\*\*\*[**Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center**](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx) **\(MVLS\) ISO**
* \*\*\*\*[**Microsoft Developer Network**](https://msdn.microsoft.com) **\(MSDN\) ISO**
* \*\*\*\*[**Microsoft Media Creation Tool**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) **\(ESD Format\) ISO**

## Import-OSMedia

Once you have the DVD or ISO mounted, you can import the Operating System.  In PowerShell, simply use the following command

```text
Import-OSMedia
```

**OSDBuilder** will scan the drives for an Operating System to import and display the results in **GridView**.  Simply select the Operating System you want to import and press **OK**
