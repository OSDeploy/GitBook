## Create a Windows Image Catalog

Open Windows System Image Manager to Select a Windows Image

In this example, I will be Servicing Windows 10 Enterprise x64 1809.  The Install.wim will be mounted and a Catalog will be created

The Catalog will be saved in the Sources directory with the Install.wim.  This file can be used for future builds with Windows System Image Manager so it doesn't have to mount the Install.wim

When complete, Packages will contain detailed information about the Windows Image

The Unattend XML is now ready to be added to a **`New-OSBuildTask`**
