# Windows System Image Manager

You can easily create a Windows Unattend with Windows System Image Manager \(ADK\) to use in OSDBuilder

## Create a Windows Image Catalog

Open Windows System Image Manager to Select a Windows Image

In this example, I will be Servicing Windows Server 2019 \(Desktop Experience\).  The Install.wim will be mounted and a Catalog will be created

![](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2853%29.png)

The Catalog will be saved with the Install.wim.  This file can be used for future builds with Windows System Image Manager so it doesn't have to mount the Install.wim

When complete, Packages will contain detailed information about the Windows Image

## Add Roles and Features

Select the Foundation Package and Add to Answer File

At this point you can Enable or Disable Features.  In this case I want to add SessionDirectory.  Rather than change the **Disabled** to **Enabled**, I need to **Enable Parent Features**

![](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2839%29.png)

A simple Yes will add all the required Features

When complete, press the Save button on the toolbar to create the Unattend XML.  Save this file in the Content\Unattend directory

## Resolve Validation Errors

Keep an eye out for any Validation Errors.  This will cause the Unattend XML to fail

The Unattend XML is now ready to be added to a **`New-OSBuildTask`**
