# Mount \(Managed\)

{% hint style="info" %}
**During Offline Servicing, OSDBuilder will create a Random directory in Mount to contain the mounted Windows Image \(or WinPE\).  Normally these directories are removed automatically, but in some cases \(AntiVirus, Failures\), they are not**
{% endhint %}

## Maintenance

Over time the Mount directory may contain remnants of previously mounted Windows Images.  These will need to be cleaned out from time to time

Before getting started, you should make sure you don't have any Mounted Windows Images

Then simply Select All and delete.  If you receive an error, Skip the deletion of the directory

{% hint style="warning" %}
**If you are absolutely certain a directory is no longer being used, you may Continue the deletion**
{% endhint %}

This looks much better!
