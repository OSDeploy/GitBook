# Drivers

## Root Directory Structure

Driver Content is in a Root Directory Structure format.  This means that directories in the root of **Content\Drivers** can selected in a **`New-OSBuildTask`**

## Root Directory Items

Driver Content must be organized in directories.  The name should either be an Operating System \(with sub-directories, or in individual Driver directories\)
