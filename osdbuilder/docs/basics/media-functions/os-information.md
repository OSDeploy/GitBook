# OS Information

Every time an Operating System is mounted, information is exported and saved in the info directory.  To recover space, you may clear out any historical information that contains a date in the file name, but all other files are required by **OSDBuilder** and should not be deleted.  You can easily view the TXT files for information

## Show-OSDBuilderInfo

To have PowerShell display the information about any **OSDBuilder Media** \(OSMedia, OSBuild, or PEBuild\), the following command can be used

```text
Show-OSDBuilderInfo
```

You will be prompted to select an **OSDBuilder Media** and press OK
