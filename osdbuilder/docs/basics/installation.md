## Upgrade from OSBuilder

OSDBuilder is a completely separate PowerShell Module and it uses most of the same functions as OSBuilder.  These two Modules cannot coexist, and OSBuilder should be removed first

Uninstall-Module OSBuilder -AllVersions -Force
Install-Module OSDBuilder -Force
Import-Module OSDBuilder -Force
```
