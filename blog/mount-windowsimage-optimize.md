description: Mount-WindowsImage with the Optimize Parameter does not seem to work properly

# Mount-WindowsImage -Optimize

According to Microsoft Docs, when you [**`Mount-WindowsImage`**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/dism/mount-windowsimage?view=win10-ps), you can add the **`Optimize`** parameter

> The Optimize parameter reduces the amount of time it takes to initially mount the image. However, processes that are ordinarily performed during a mount will instead be completed the first time that you access a directory. As a result, there may be an increase in the time that is required to access a directory for the first time after mounting an image using the Optimize parameter.

## The Test

I can test this in PowerShell using the following script to see how much longer it takes to Mount a Windows Image without using the Optimize parameter

```text
#Windows 10 x64 1809
Write-Host "Windows 10 x64 1809" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Measure-Command {
    Mount-WindowsImage -Path "C:\DEV\Optimize\Mount" `
    -ImagePath "C:\DEV\Optimize\1809.wim" `
    -Index 1 | Out-Null
}
Dismount-WindowsImage -Path "C:\DEV\Optimize\Mount" -Discard | Out-Null

#Windows 10 x64 1809 Optimize
Write-Host "Windows 10 x64 1809 -Optimize" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Measure-Command {
    Mount-WindowsImage -Path "C:\DEV\Optimize\Mount" `
    -ImagePath "C:\DEV\Optimize\1809.wim" `
    -Index 1 -Optimize | Out-Null
}
Dismount-WindowsImage -Path "C:\DEV\Optimize\Mount" -Discard | Out-Null
```

## The Results

I initially ran the script after a clean boot.  After the first test, I swapped the processing order and rebooted to run the script a second time.

| Win10 1809 x64 | Win10 1809 x64 Optimize |
| :--- | :--- |
| 54.881 seconds | 64.306 seconds |
| 48.171 seconds | 78.166 seconds |

As you can see the results were quite the opposite of what I expected according to the Microsoft Docs.

## Recommendation

I cannot recommend using the Optimize parameter when mounting a Windows Image, add this to the fact that in Windows 10 1809 you [cannot remove Appx Provisioned Packages offline when using Optimize](windows-10-1809-appx-issues.md)
