Open PowerShell as Administrator and make sure that your Script Execution Policy allows you to install the Module first

## Updating PowerShell Module OSDriver

If you have an older version, to prevent having duplicates show up in PowerShell ISE, remove any old versions first, then simply run an install to get the latest version

```
