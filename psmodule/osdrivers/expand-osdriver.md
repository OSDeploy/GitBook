# Expand-OSDriver

In some cases, Drivers will be compressed.  Nvidia likes to do this with their Drivers to save space.  You can read about this on my Nvidia Video Drivers page.

Expand-OSDriver will expand and rename the files as well as giving the option to remove some Nvidia Junk.

## -Path

This is the directory of the Drivers you want to expand.  If you have multiple Directories, this can be used on the Parent Directory as well.

---

## -ExpandCompressedFiles

Selecting this option will expand these files and rename them with their proper extension

## -RemoveNvidiaJunk

When selecting the RemoveNvidiaJunk switch, the following directories will be removed to save space as they contain no Drivers

```
"Display.NView",
"Display.Optimus",
"Display.Update",
"DisplayDriverCrashAnalyzer",
"GFExperience",
"GFExperience.NvStreamSrv",
"MSVCRT",
"nodejs",
"NV3DVision",
"NvBackend",
"NvCamera",
"NvContainer",
"NVI2",
"NvTelemetry",
"NVWMI",
"PhysX",
"ShadowPlay",
"Update.Core"
```

## Example

In the Example pictured at the top of this page, the initial extracted size with compressed files was 1.09 GB.  After running -ExpandCompressedFiles the size increased to 1.30 GB.

The -RemoveNvidiaJunk cleared enough space to make this Driver .59 GB.

```

This is ready to be imported into MDT or ConfigMgr.  If you are using this with OSDrivers, converting this to a High Compression CAB will only use 250 MB of space.
