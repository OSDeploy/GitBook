# Offline Servicing - The Complete Process

I wanted to take the time to explain all the steps involved with Offline Servicing a Windows Image.  This will primarily focus on Windows 10, but the same methods should also be applied to Windows Server 2016.

### A Simple Definition

Offline Servicing is a method that has been used for years to Mount a Windows Image, Apply Patches, and Save the Image.  The reason we do this is to save time in our OS Deployments, so we do not have to spend hours applying patches.  When Microsoft releases a new ISO, it is fully patched up to the point that they sealed it.  In the image below are the Windows 10 Builds with the updated date.  Windows 10 1803 is the only version that has been updated this year.
