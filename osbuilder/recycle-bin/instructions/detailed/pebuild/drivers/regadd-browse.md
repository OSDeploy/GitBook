# RegAdd Browse

{% file src="../../../../../../.gitbook/assets/regadd-browse.inf" %}

If you want to restore the ability to Browse for files in WinPE, you will need to add this Driver and the following files to System32 \(including MUI\):

* shellstyle\*
* explorerframe\*
* StructuredQuery\*
* edputil\*

These files are automatically collected by [**Auto ExtraFiles**](../auto-extrafiles.md) so they can be easily added to WinPE

A quick test in WinPE is to open TaskMgr and Run a New Task.  After adding this Driver and the above files, you can now Browse for files.

## PowerShell

And yes, you can even use this with PowerShell, so now you can make a proper WIM Backup and Restore GUI
