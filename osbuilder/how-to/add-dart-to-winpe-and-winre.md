### Copy DaRT Config DAT File

### Proper File Structure

Here is what your files should look like.  It doesn't matter whether the configuration file is named DaRTConfig.dat or DaRTConfig8.dat, OSBuilder handles both, just make sure you copied the DaRTConfig8.dat for Windows 10.

### Validating DaRT in WinRE

After creating an OSBuild, test the image on a system.  To boot to WinRE, open an elevated command prompt and enter the following

```
reagentc /boottore
```

Reboot the computer, and Windows RE should come up
