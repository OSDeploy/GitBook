# Update-OSMedia

You should repeat this process after new Cumulative Updates are released every Monthly Patch Tuesday

## Update-OSMedia

Update-OSMedia is used to apply Patches to an imported OSMedia.  Previous versions of OSBuilder required the creation of a Task to specify the Update sources, but this is no longer required.

Simply execute Update-OSMedia without any Parameters.  You will be prompted to select an imported OSMedia \(PowerShell ISE is required to select the Operating System for now\).  Make a selection and press OK.

When running Update-OSMedia without any parameters and selecting an Operating System, information will be displayed.  This will also include a list of Microsoft Updates that will be applied.
