# OSBuilder: Getting Started

I recommend running OSBuilder in PowerShell ISE \(as Administrator\) until you get familiar with the steps.  The first step of using OSBuilder is to run Get-OSBuilder.

### OSMedia

If you used my previous attempt at this called OSMedia, you will need to get rid of it first.

### Get-OSBuilder

There are a few parameters to OSBuilder, but running Get-OSBuilder without a parameter will give you a listing of your OSBuilder components.

### Get-OSBuilder -OSBuilderPath

If you want to redirect OSBuilder to a different location, use this parameter

### Get-OSBuilder -CreatePaths

If you are satisfied with the OSBuilder path, using this parameter will set the OSBuilder structure

And the same structure in Windows Explorer
