# Execute a Task in Test Mode

You can execute a Task using Invoke-OSBuilder.  Simply select a PatchUpdate.  I strongly recommend running this in TestMode first with -Verbose

### Select Task\(s\)

You have the option to select multiple Tasks, which will run sequentially.  If you are applying the CU and performing an Image Cleanup, the process may take from 30 minutes to an hour, so if you are running multiple, do it overnight :\)
