# Create an OS USB

> OSBuilder 18.7.26+

You can easily create a USB of your OSMedia or OSBuild using **New-OSBuilderUSB**.  Since the USB will be formatted in FAT32, it must be 32GB or smaller, but large enough to fit your OS.  So to play it save 8-32GB should do it.

### -USBLabel "Ent1803 x64"

The USB Drive Label cannot exceed 11 characters \(FAT32 limitation\).  You have been warned.
