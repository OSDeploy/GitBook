# Run a Task in TestMode

Before executing any Task, I strongly recommend running things in TestMode and with the -Verbose parameter.  Since a Task on a good computer will take 30 minutes to an hour, this may save you some time in pointing out issues.

```
Invoke-OSBuilder -TestMode -Verbose
```

### Execution

Running a Task with TestMode will place the Build in OSBuilder\TestMode.  These can be deleted after you ensure everything operated properly.
