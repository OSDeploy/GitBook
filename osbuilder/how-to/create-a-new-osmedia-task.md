# Create a New OSMedia Task

You can update existing OSMedia by performing the following tasks

* Apply the latest Servicing Stack
* Apply the latest Cumulative Updates
* Dism /Image-Cleanup
* All WinPE's applied with the latest SSU and CU's
  * WinPE \(Boot.wim Index 1\)
  * Windows Setup \(Boot.wim Index 2\)
  * WinRE

An OSMedia Task does NOT perform any additional customizations \(that would be an OSBuild\)
