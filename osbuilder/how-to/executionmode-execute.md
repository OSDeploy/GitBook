# ExecutionMode - Execute

Exactly what you think it does.  This will process your Task without stops, full speed.

OSMedia Tasks will take the longest.  If you are updating an RTM Operating System, be prepared for the process to take 30 minutes \(x86\) to an hour \(x64\) depending on how many updates are needed.  If you are updating an existing OSMedia that is a month out of date, 20-30 minutes on an i7 with SSD is typical.

OSBuild Tasks should take 15-30 minutes to customize the Operating System, depending on the complexity of your build.

Keep in mind that you can select multiple Tasks to execute, one right after the other.  OSMedia Tasks are always processed first, then OSBuild Tasks.  It is recommended that if you want to completely update your OSMedia and OSBuild Library, select them, Execute, and come back tomorrow.
