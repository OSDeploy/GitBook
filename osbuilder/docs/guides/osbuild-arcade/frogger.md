# Frogger

Its time to have a little fun and get some learning done at the same time.  This name of this game is **Frogger**.

## New OSBuilder Home

To make things easier to follow and not clutter things up, I am going to start with a brand new OSBuilder Home.  I'll use the following command

```text
OSBuilder -SetPath C:\OSDeploy\Frogger
```

## Import-OSMedia

I'll import a brand new Operating System using the following command

```text
Import-OSMedia
```

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/2019-02-04_22-28-14.png)

You will want to have your OSMedia updated by using **`Update-OSMedia`**, but for this game, it is not really necessary

## Frogger Arcade Pack

Now its time to download the Frogger Arcade Pack.  Download and Unzip the attached Zip file

{% file src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/frogger-arcade-pack.zip" %}

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/2019-02-04_22-34-21.png)

Now its time to place the Zip contents in the proper locations

## Frogger Registry

Move the contents of Frogger Registry into your **Templates\Registry\AutoApply\Windows 10**.  This will ensure that the Registry entries get applied to every Windows 10 OSBuild

## Frogger Wallpaper

Copy the entire Frogger Wallpaper directory into the **Templates\ExtraFiles\AutoApply\Windows 10** directory.  This will ensure that the contents of Frogger Wallpaper are copied into the OS of every Windows 10 OSBuild

## PowerShell Script

To have the PowerShell Script executed with every OSBuild, no matter the Operating System, copy it into the **Templates\Scripts\AutoApply\Global** directory

## Start Layout

Finally, copy the **Windows 10.xml** file into the **Content\StartLayout** directory

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/2019-02-04_22-45-02.png)

## New-OSBuildTask

Now create a New-OSBuildTask with the following command line

```text
New-OSBuildTask -TaskName Frogger -CustomName Frogger
```

You will select the Operating System, and then be prompted to select a Start Layout.  Select the one that was added from the Frogger Arcade Pack

## New-OSBuild

Now its time to execute the OSBuild.  The SkipUpdates parameter is used to prevent the Windows Updates from being applied.  This will save a significant amount of time and should be used for testing only.  The MediaISO will create an ISO \(ADK required\) and allow us to test the image in a Virtual Machine

```text
New-OSBuild -SkipUpdates -Execute -MediaISO
```

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/2019-02-04_22-53-41.png)

During the OSBuild process, the following steps will be completed

* **Frogger Wallpaper added to Templates\ExtraFiles will be added automatically**
* **Start Layout.xml from the Task will be applied**
* **TimeZone Script added to the Templates\Scripts will be added automatically**
* **Registry REG files added Templates\Registry will be converted to Offline Registry files**

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/2019-02-04_23-15-14.png)

* **Offline Registry files will be applied**
* **ISO will be created**

## Virtual Machine Testing

Now time to do some setup

## Frogger Results

* Desktop Icons were added by the Template Registry REG **User Desktop Icons.reg**
* Wallpaper was added by Template ExtraFiles **Frogger Wallpaper**

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/2019-02-05_0-21-11.png)

* **C:\Windows\Web\4K\Wallpaper\Windows** contains different size Wallpaper.  If the Screen Resolution matches one of these Wallpaper dimensions, it will be applied

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/2019-02-05_0-30-12.png)

* Changing the Screen Resolution to a size that is not represented by the 4K wallpaper results in Windows using **C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\img0.jpg**, which is the Frogger Wallpaper

* OEM Information was modified by the Template Registry **Computer OEMInformation.reg**

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/2019-02-05_0-24-55.png)

* Control Panel displays small icons by Template Registry **User Control Panel View.reg**

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/2019-02-05_0-25-36.png)

* Windows Explorer view was set using a few different Template Registry files
  * **User Explorer Advanced.reg**
  * **User Explorer Title Bar Full Path.reg**
  * **Win10 User Remove OneDrive Setup.reg**

## Game Over

I hope that this example shows the new changes to OSBuilder and that it can be as easy as playing a game.  **Happy jumping and watch out for moving cars!**
