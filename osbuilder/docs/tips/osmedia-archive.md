# OSMedia Archive

When you perform a successful [**`Update-OSMedia`**](../functions/osmedia/update-osmedia/), the OSMedia directory will contain multiple directories with different UBRs \(the higher the number, the newer the Patch level\)

This may also lead to confusion as you are presented with multiple UBRs of the same Windows Version

Its a good idea to MOVE previous UBRs into a subdirectory of OSMedia called **Archive**

This results in less confusion going forward \(future releases of OSBuilder may do this automatically\)

 I recommend keeping the original Imported version and the previous version if your Drive Space permits, you may even need to use an OSMedia Archive when you get a [**Failed UBR Change**](osmedia-failed-ubr-change.md)\*\*\*\*
