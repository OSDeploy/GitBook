# Rename-OSMedia

## Purpose

Rename OSMedia is used to change the OSMedia Directory Name from the Abbreviated Naming Format to the Full Name Format.  PowerShell ISE is required for GridView to function properly

## Example

When looking in my OSBuilder's OSMedia directory, new imports are displayed without abbreviations, whereas my older versions contain abbreviations.  Additionally Language information is displayed before the UBR.
