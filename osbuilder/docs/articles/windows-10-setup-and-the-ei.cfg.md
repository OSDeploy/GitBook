# Windows 10 Setup and the ei.cfg

Windows 10 1709 and 1803 Volume License media includes multiple Indexes in the WIM.  When booting one of these ISO's in a VM and starting Windows Setup, we can see the different options for installation.  This screen was not displayed prior to 1709 as those ISO's contain a single Index in the WIM.

### ei.cfg

Additionally, older Media had a file called ei.cfg in the SOURCES directory which contained the EditionID \(ei\).  Since Multi Index ISO's contain multiple versions of Windows, this file does not contain the EditionID.

### Install.wim Multi-Index and ei.cfg with EditionID

I can modify the ei.cfg by adding the EditionID and then create a new ISO.  During Windows Setup, I am not prompted to select an Edition, even though my install.wim has multiple Indexes.

### Install.wim Single-Index and ei.cfg without EditionID

The Install.wim only has the Enterprise Index, and the ei.cfg does not contain the EditionID.  In this case, no prompt to select an Edition.

### Install.wim Multi-Index and ei.cfg without EditionID with AutoUnattend.xml Key

Because why not.  In this example I have added the KMS Client Setup Key to a simple AutoUnattend.xml

```text
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<unattend xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:unattend">
    <settings pass="windowsPE">
        <component name="Microsoft-Windows-Setup" processorArchitecture="amd64" publicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35" language="neutral" versionScope="nonSxS" xmlns:wcm="http://schemas.microsoft.com/WMIConfig/2002/State" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

Windows Setup knows which Key corresponds with the proper Edition

### Upgrade Issues

Adam Gross encountered an issue when upgrading Windows 7 to Windows 10 in a CM Task Sequence that started happening on version 1709 \(Multi Index\)

According to Microsoft, the product key is not required, but apparently in the case of a Multi-Index Install.wim you have to.

### OSDeploy Recommendation

To reduce the risk of any issues, always include the proper KMS Client Setup Key in the Task Sequence.  **No changes to OSBuilder to modify the ei.cfg are planned unless I receive confirmation that it needs to be edited.  Since all OSMedia imported in OSBuilder is a Single Index, it appears that this issue will not occur.**
