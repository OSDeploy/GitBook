## Windows Media

You will need to Import an Operating System to use with OSBuilder. This must be done with the original DVD or a mounted ISO. You can use any of the following Media

* \*\*\*\*[**Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center**](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx) **\(MVLS\) ISO**
* \*\*\*\*[**Microsoft Developer Network**](https://msdn.microsoft.com) **\(MSDN\) ISO**
* \*\*\*\*[**Microsoft Media Creation Tool**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) **\(ESD Format\) ISO**

## Import-OSMedia

Once you have the DVD or ISO mounted, you can import the Operating System. In PowerShell, simply enter the following command

```text
Import-OSMedia
```

OSBuilder will scan the drives for an Operating System to import and display the results in GridView. Simply select the Operating System you want to import and press OK

Once mounted, a full inventory will be saved, and the Operating System will be copied into OSBuilder's OSMedia. This will take between 5-10 minutes to complete per Operating System Edition
