# Add Drivers

You can easily add Drivers to an OSBuild.  In this example, I'm going to add two must have drivers

## Intel Wireless

Start by heading to this link

{% embed url="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000017246/network-and-i-o/wireless-networking.html" %}

From there you will want to select the latest version.  Hit the Download link

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2821%29.png)

Now download the Zip files you need 

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2817%29.png)

Save the files in your &lt;OSBuilderHome&gt;\Content\Drivers

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

Expand the Zip and give the directories a friendly name

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

## Intel Bluetooth

Here is your link for Intel Bluetooth Drivers

{% embed url="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005773/network-and-i-o/wireless-networking.html" %}

Same deal as before, get the latest

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%288%29.png)

Get the Zips that you need

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2829%29.png)

Expand the Zips and give it a friendly name, you know the drill

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2830%29.png)

## Intel Ethernet

Now get the latest Drivers for Intel Ethernet from this link

{% embed url="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/36773/Ethernet-Products" %}

Make sure you get the latest

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

Download the Drivers you need.  These should be in EXE format \(self extracting\), but 7-Zip can expand them.  No need to rename these directories, we have some work to do

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

## Intel Wireless Driver Structure

Checking the Intel Wireless Driver Directory, everything is perfect.  THIS is the format that we need the drivers in.  There is no work to do here

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2828%29.png)

## Intel Bluetooth Driver Structure

These Drivers are NOT going to work.  These are EXE\MSI based, so we need to get these expanded.  Execute the MSI file

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2816%29.png)

And complete the installation

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2810%29.png)

Save these two directories back in your Intel Bluetooth Driver directory in OSBuilder

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2823%29.png)

Like so

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2834%29.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you need Windows 10 x86 Intel Bluetooth Drivers, you will need to repeat this process on a system with Windows 10 x86
{% endhint %}

## Intel Ethernet Driver Structure

This is the tricky one, so please keep up.  Give the extracted drivers a friendly name.  Now create empty directories for as many Operating Systems that you support in OSBuilder

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2813%29.png)

Delete these selected files, they are not needed

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2818%29.png)

Drilling down into each remaining directory, you will find a readme.txt which tells you what OS is supported

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2820%29.png)

Go through each of the directories and each of the readme.txt.  Delete the directories you don't care about, and move the ones you do care about into the appropriate Operating System

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2811%29.png)

You may come across a directory without a readme.txt.  Just use some common sense \(NDIS62 . . . Windows 6.2 . . . Windows 7?\)

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

You may even come across a readme.txt that has two Operating Systems that you support, so copy them

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2838%29.png)

Eventually you will run into some WinPE Drivers.  Move them where they need to be \(unzip as needed\)

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2831%29.png)

Here is what your Intel Ethernet Drivers look like if you need everything

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)

## WinPE Drivers

Copy these Drivers to your WinPE Drivers

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2824%29.png)

## New-OSBuildTask

Now create a New-OSBuildTask.  You will be prompted to select directories the Directories that you added.  Select the ones that apply to your OS and press OK

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2826%29.png)

Since you copied the Driver directories into WinPE\Drivers, you will be prompted to select Drivers to apply to WinPE.  Select the proper ones \([and yes, you can add Wireless support](https://www.scconfigmgr.com/2018/03/06/build-a-winpe-with-wireless-support/)\)

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2822%29.png)

## New-OSBuild

Now you can execute your Task and the Drivers will be applied automatically, or you can add these as a [Template](../../guides/templates.md) and these will be applied depending on where you save your Template
