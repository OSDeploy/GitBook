### Automatic Update Catalog Download

If you are online and run OSBuilder, the Update Catalogs will be validated for a newer version.  If there is an update available, old Update Catalogs will be removed and new ones will be downloaded as needed.  Catalogs have a Date or Version information in the file name as needed and are relocated to the Updates root
