# What Should I Update?

OSBuilder updates everything to handle all these different scenarios

---

### Image from ISO

* Install.wim
* Setup WIM \(Boot.wim Index 2\)
* Sources directory on the Media

---

### Upgrade Scenario

* Install.wim
* WinPE WIM \(Boot.wim Index 1\)
* Sources directory on the Media

Unfortunately I didn't delete winpeshl.ini from WinPE and was faced with "initialize network in the background" prompt.  This confirms that WinPE is used and should be updated.

### MDT or CM Task Sequence

* Install.wim

---

### Recovery or Push Button Reset

* Install.wim
* WinRE WIM
