### What is a Servicing Stack?

You can google or bing and find many different answers, but the simple answer is this and there are many different answers depending on who or why you ask.  But for the purpose of my audience, the question probably relates to applying a Windows Update Package \(Cumulative Update\) to a Windows Image \(offline\).  So now the simple answer.

**The Servicing Stack tells the Operating System \(online or offline\) how to process a Windows Update \(Package\)**

Think of it as two people that only speak different languages.  Neither person will understand each other, unless they speak the same language.  In other words, an Operating System doesn't understand what to do with the Update Package, unless they are speaking the same language.
