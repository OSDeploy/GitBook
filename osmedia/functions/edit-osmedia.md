# Edit-OSMedia

This function will optionally allow you to remove Appx Packages or Windows Components.  It is recommended that this step be completed AFTER running an Update-OSMedia.  Some changes that are made using Edit-OSMedia may be Pending.  When the Windows Image has Pending changes, you cannot run DISM Component Cleanup to shrink down a Windows Image.
