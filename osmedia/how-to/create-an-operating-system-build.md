# Create an Operating System Build

**Reference:**  
[New-OSBuild](/osmedia/reference/new-osbuild.md)

An Operating System Build is Windows Image that will be Updated or Edited since I should not make changes to a Library Operating System \(as those are intended for unmodified Windows Images\)

In PowerShell ISE, select New-OSBuild and enter the OSBuildName as **Windows 10 Enterprise 1803 x64 DEV** and press Run
