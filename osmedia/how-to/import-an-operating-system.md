### Know Your Update Information

If you download Windows 10 from the Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center, each download of Windows 10 has an updated date.  Make a note of this information.

### Mount Windows 10 1803 x64

Mount the ISO as a Drive, as you normally would in Windows Explorer

### Import-OSMedia

Since each imported Operating System will need to be unique, make sure the updated information is in the NewOSMediaName

```
Import-OSMedia -NewOSMediaName "Windows 10 Enterprise 1803 x64 2018-03"
```

### Multiple Windows Images

After running the PowerShell command, the Operating System Image will be checked for multiple Windows Images within the install.wim.  Select a single Operating System to import and press OK.
