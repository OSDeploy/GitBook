### Copy-OSMedia

Start by copying an Operating System

```

### Edit-OSMedia

In this example the Action will be "**Stay Mounted**'.  This will allow us to go through the Edit-OSMedia process repeatedly without saving to mount and dismount the Windows Image.

### -ManageCapabilities

Selecting this parameter will display all the installed Windows Capabilities, allowing you to select and remove as needed.  I do not suggest removing any of these Capabilities.  Press Cancel if you decide to not remove anything.

### -ApplyNetFX3

Selecting this parameter will install .NET 3.5 in your Windows Image.  This Package will cause the Windows Image to have Pending Operations, so you will not be able to Start Component Cleanup after installing the package.

### -Action "Stay Mounted"

Since the Action Parameter was set to "Stay Mounted", the Windows Image is not dismounted.  This allows Edit-OSMedia to be run additional times without waiting for the Windows Image to Mount / Dismount Save.  When all edits are complete, make sure the Action is set to "**Dismount Save**"

### Production Copy

It is recommended to make a copy for Production, this way the ImageName is set properly.  A simple Copy-OSMedia is all that is needed.

```
Copy-OSMedia -NewOSMediaName "Windows 10 Enterprise 1803 x64 2018-06 Release"
```

Now take this Operating System and import it into MDT or SCCM and start deploying!
