# Build an OSMedia Library

The best way to build a proper OSMedia library is to repeat the steps in [Import an Operating System](/osmedia/how-to/import-an-operating-system.md) for every version that you support.  Download all the ISO's from MVLS or MSDN.  Make a note of the updated date and use those in your naming convention.

If we use the image below as our example

Then you should use the following naming standards as they include the date of the last update

```
Windows 10 Enterprise 1607 x86 2016-11
Windows 10 Enterprise 1607 x64 2016-11
Windows 10 Enterprise 1703 x64 2017-07
Windows 10 Enterprise 1703 x86 2017-07
Windows 10 Enterprise 1709 x64 2017-12
Windows 10 Enterprise 1709 x86 2017-12
Windows 10 Enterprise 1803 x64 2018-03
Windows 10 Enterprise 1803 x86 2018-03
```
