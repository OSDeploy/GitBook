# Build an Operating System Library

The best way to build a proper OSMedia library is to repeat the steps in [Import an Operating System](/osmedia/how-to/import-an-operating-system.md) for every version that you support.  Download all the ISO's from MVLS or MSDN.  Make a note of the updated date and use those in your naming convention.

This will translate to the following naming standards

```
Windows 10 Enterprise 1607 x86 2016-11
Windows 10 Enterprise 1607 x64 2016-11
Windows 10 Enterprise 1703 x64 2017-07
Windows 10 Enterprise 1703 x86 2017-07
Windows 10 Enterprise 1709 x64 2017-12
Windows 10 Enterprise 1709 x86 2017-12
Windows 10 Enterprise 1803 x64 2018-03
Windows 10 Enterprise 1803 x86 2018-03
```
