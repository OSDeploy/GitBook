# What's New

Builds are being introduced to replace the traditional method of having all Imported and Working Operating Systems in the same directory.  If you have already worked with OSMedia 18.06.25 then move any edited Operating Systems into an OSMedia\Builds directory.  Imported Operating Systems should stay in OSMedia\Library.

### Understanding Builds

Builds are edited copies of OSMedia Library Imported Operating Systems or previous edited Operating System Builds

If you have existing edited media, relocate them to a Builds directory in OSMedia
