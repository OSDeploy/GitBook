# Set-OSMedia

The default OSMedia paths won't work for everyone, so you are able to make changes on your own.  Changing a setting using Set-OSMedia will also write the changes to the Registry

### -PathOSMedia

Making a change to the main directory will result in a change of all child directories.  In the example below a the OSMedia Path has been changed from C:\OSMedia to D:\OSMedia

This change will also result in setting this Value in the Registry

### -PathOSLibrary

I recommend keeping this as the default under the OSMedia parent directory

---

### -PathOSMount

You can certainly make a change to the Mount directory without any issues.
