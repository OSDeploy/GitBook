# Depricated: Edit-OSMedia

* 18.06.26 This function is removed and has been replaced by [Edit-OSBuild](edit-osbuild.md)
* 18.06.25 Initial Release

## Edit-OSMedia

This function will optionally allow you to remove Appx Packages or Windows Components. It is recommended that this step be completed AFTER running an Update-OSMedia. Some changes that are made using Edit-OSMedia may be Pending Changes. When the Windows Image has Pending Changes, you cannot run DISM Component Cleanup to shrink down a Windows Image.

### -Action "Dismount Save"

After all edit options are complete, the Windows Image will be dismounted and saved.

```text
Dismount-WindowsImage -Path "$PathOSMount" -Save
```

### -Action "Dismount Discard"

After all edit options are complete, the Windows Image will be dismounted without saving. This option is ideal for validating a Windows Image

```text
Dismount-WindowsImage -Path "$PathOSMount" -Discard
```

### -Action "Stay Mounted"

You can execute Edit-OSMedia multiple times if you do not dismount the Windows Image. This is ideal for making multiples passes to ensure that you have made the correct changes. When you are done making edits, simply change the Action to a Dismount option.
