# Future Plans

I will be adding the ability to inject some more advanced changes into a Windows Image . . . let me know if there is something you want me to add!

## Fully Automated

I will be working on adding some additional parameters to allow everything to run without prompting and selecting. For example, anything that is removed using OSMedia is logged and saved in an XML file. These can easily be reconstructed for automation in future releases.
