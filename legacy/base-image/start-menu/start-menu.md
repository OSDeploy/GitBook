# Start Menu

You have a decision to make . . . should you leave the default out of the box Start Menu?  Should you customize it?

Fortunately, Microsoft has made this decision easy by giving you the Xbox and Movies & TV Apps Windows Store Apps.  I don't know Microsoft's logic in including these in the Enterprise edition, so in this section, we are going to get rid of ~~the clutter~~ these Apps.

Interestingly enough if we build Windows 10 Enterprise with no Internet connection, we get placeholders for these Apps.  They will be populated as soon as we get an internet connection.
