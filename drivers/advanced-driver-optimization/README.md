# Advanced Driver Optimization

Advanced Driver Optimization takes things up a level from standard Driver Optimization.

**Manufacturer Core Drivers** - Just like Core Drivers, this process consolidates Manufacturer Drivers.  This requires more time but results in smaller Driver Packages.

**Driver Compression** - Deploying drivers into a compressed format, such as a CAB, will reduce the Driver Repository by at least 50%

**Using both of the methods above has achieved full Windows 10 x64 support on all Dell systems, using less than 3 GB of Total Drivers.**

I will work on detailing this process soon . . .
