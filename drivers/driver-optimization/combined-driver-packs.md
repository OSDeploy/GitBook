# Combined Driver Packs

Using Family Packs instead of Model Packs can help in reducing the size of your Driver Repository

## Dell

If I were to download all of the Dell Model Packs, I would need over 190 GB of space.  Switching to Dell Family Packs will reduce your Driver Repository to just under 80 GB.  Additionally, managing 28 Driver Packages is much easier than working with 138 Driver Packages.

| Driver Method | Number of Packs | Downloaded Size | Extracted Size |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Dell Model Packs | 138 | 84.1 GB | 191.70 GB |
| Dell Family Packs | 28 | 37.8 GB | 76.87 GB |
