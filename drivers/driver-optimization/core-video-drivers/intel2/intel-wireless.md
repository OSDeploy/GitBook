# Wi-Fi Intel Drivers

The Intel Wireless Drivers should be downloaded from Intel using the IT Administrator Links.  This can be found at [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000017246/network-and-i-o/wireless-networking.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000017246/network-and-i-o/wireless-networking.html)

From that link, you should be able to open another link to the latest version.
