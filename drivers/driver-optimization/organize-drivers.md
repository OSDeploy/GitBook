# Organize Drivers

You need to develop a logical organization for your Drivers.  The following is my Directory Structure for my Driver Repository

* Drivers should be placed in a proper Category
* Manufacturers should be identified
* Logical Drivers should be segmented.  For example, I know my Video Drivers will take the most space.  I should have them in a standalone Category not nested under anything else.
* For large Drivers, such as Video, segmenting them further with Architecture in the Directory Name is ideal

## Subsets

There is a large benefit to using this method.  If I wanted to copy my Repository to somewhere else, but only wanted Windows 10 x64, then a simple Robocopy command would be able to handle this

```
robocopy %source% %destination% *.* /mir /ndl /xd *Win7* *x86*
```

The important thing about my robocopy switches is that it will exclude any directory with Win7 or x86 in the name.  The result will be a **subset** of your Driver Repository.

Video

    Intel x64
    Nvidia x64
```

This is absolutely critical.  You should NOT have more than one Driver Repository as they become difficult to manage.  If you work with MDT and OSD, you should know that it becomes impossible to keep them at parity.  You should leverage a MASTER Driver Repository and work with Subsets.

## File Naming Convention

While the Directory Name is important, File Naming is even more critical.  The following parameters should be identified in every file name

* **Category**
* **Manufacturer**
* **Type**
* **Version**
* **OS**
* **Architecture**

In the screenshot below, it is very easy to see what each Driver would apply to.  In the case of **Video Nvidia Quadro 390.65 Win10 x64**, I know that this is an Nvidia Quadro Video Driver Version 390.65 and it is supported on Windows 10 x64 only.

## File Subsets

Just as we have a Directory Subset, File subsets are easy to manage.  By adding a /XF \(exclude file\) switch, I can easily filter out Windows 7 and x86 Drivers at the File level as well.

```
robocopy %source% %destination% *.* /mir /ndl /xd *Win7* *x86* /xf *Win7* *x86*
```

So the naming of both your Directories and your Files are equally important.  Keep in mind this only applies because my individual Drivers are compressed in a CAB.  If you have loose individual files, you cannot do this as you may exclude some Driver Files.
