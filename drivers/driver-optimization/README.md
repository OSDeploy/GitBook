# Driver Management

If you use Manufacturer Driver Packs, you can immediately start your OS Deployments, but you are missing out on Driver Optimization.  Driver Optimization includes the following

* **Driver Validation** - Mistakes happen.  Are you sure the Driver Packs you are using are properly built?

* **Driver Updates** - Driver Packs age, become stale and forgotten.  They need updates.

* **Repository Organization** - Organizing your Drivers into a logical structure that is easy to Manage and Maintain

* **Driver Consolidation** - Removing multiple or redundant Drivers

* **Driver Compression** - Delivering Compressed Packs and Extracting at OS Deployment
