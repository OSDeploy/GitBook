# Driver Optimization

Once you Download and Extract your Computer Drivers, you can immediately start your OS Deployments, but you are missing out on Driver Optimization.  Driver Optimization includes the following

* **Validation** - Mistakes can and do happen.  Downloading and importing without Validation has problems

* **Update** - Updating your aging Drivers can provide a benefit to your Operating System.

* **Organization** - Organizing your Drivers into a logical structure that is easy to Manage and Maintain

* **Consolidation** - Removing multiple or redundant Drivers

* **Compression** - Delivering Compressed Packs and Extracting at OS Deployment
