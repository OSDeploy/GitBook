# Driver Optimization

**Driver Optimization is a Driver Management Method with the following considerations**

* **Combine Driver Packs** - Use Family Packs that apply to multiple Computer Models instead of individual Computer Models
* **Organize Drivers** - I will organize my Driver Repository in a logical, structured format
* **Validate Drivers** - I will validate the Drivers that I have to ensure they are accurate and necessary
* **Core Drivers** - Core Drivers apply to multiple Driver Packs. These include Bluetooth, Chipset, Network, Storage, Video, and Wireless Drivers. What about Audio? More on that later.

## Benefits

Reduced size allows for easier Driver Management and faster Deployments. Additionally reduced strain on your Network, and reduced utilization of your Distribution Servers.
