# Driver Optimization

**Driver Optimization is a Driver Management Method with the following considerations**

* **Combined Driver Packs** - Use Family Packs that apply to multiple Computer Models instead of individual Computer Models

* **Organize Drivers** - I will organize my Driver Repository in a logical, structured format

* **Validate Drivers**  - I will validate the Drivers that I have to ensure they are accurate and necessary

* **Build a Core Driver Set** - Core Drivers apply to multiple Driver Packs.  These include Bluetooth, Chipset, Network, Storage, Video, and Wireless Drivers.  What about Audio?  More on that later.

* **\(Advanced\) Consolidate Manufacturer Drivers** - I may find that I have the same Driver in multiple Driver Packages, and they may all be different versions.  These Duplicates that are taking space in Multiple Packages should be consolidated into a Core Driver Pack.

* **\(Advanced \) Driver Compression** - Deploying Compressed Drivers will reduce my Network overhead
