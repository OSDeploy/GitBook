# Driver Optimization

Driver Optimization is the solution that I need with the following Steps.

* **Repository Organization** - I will organize my Driver Repository in a logical, structured format

* **Driver Validation** - I will validate the Drivers that I have to ensure they are accurate and necessary

* **Update Common Drivers** - Driver Packs age and become stale.  These will be updated

* **Driver Consolidation** - I may find that I have the same Driver in multiple Driver Packages, and they may all be different versions.  These Duplicates that are taking space in Multiple Packages should be consolidated into a Core Driver Pack.

* **Driver Compression** - Deploying Compressed Drivers will reduce my Network overhead
