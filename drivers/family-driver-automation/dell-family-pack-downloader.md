## Configuration - Driver Pack Download Filter

You have the ability to include and exclude Operating Systems, including Architecture.  Additionally, you have the option to include and exclude Model Branches.  We don't use XPS systems in my Enterprise, so this was the only one that I excluded.  Save the configuration.

## Downloaded CAB / ZIP Files

All of the Windows 10 Drivers \(except for the XPS Family\) require 36.2GB in the CAB / ZIP files

## Extracted Drivers

Compressed Drivers are usually about 50% smaller than uncompressed.  Here we see that once Extracted, we need 74GB of space.  This is much easier to manage if the size is a concern, although the Driver / Model Automation of %Model% no longer applies.
