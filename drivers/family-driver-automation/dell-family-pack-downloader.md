## Downloaded CAB / ZIP Files

All of the Windows 10 Drivers \(except for the XPS Family\) require 36.2GB in the CAB / ZIP files

## Extracted Drivers

Compressed Drivers are usually about 50% smaller than uncompressed.  Here we see that once Extracted, we need 74GB of space.  This is much easier to manage if the size is a concern, although the Driver / Model Automation of %Model% no longer applies.
