# Model Drivers

Model Drivers are complete CAB/ZIP/EXE/MSI files that contain all the drivers you need for a particular Computer Model.  These are also referred to as Model Driver Packs.

You can download the Model Driver Packs directly from Dell, HP, Lenovo, or Microsoft.

From there, you can import the Model Driver Packs directly into SCCM or MDT and use them for OS Deployment.
