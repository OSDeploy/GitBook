# Driver Repository

Before working with Drivers, you need to make a Driver Repository. This will be where you Download, Extract, Study, and Test the Drivers before you import them into SCCM or MDT.

When I work with Drivers, I adopt the following structure on my secondary drive. I'll detail what each of them along the way.

```
D:\Drivers
D:\Drivers\Apps
D:\Drivers\Download
D:\Drivers\Extract
D:\Drivers\Scripts
D:\Drivers\Test
D:\Drivers\Test\Alpha
D:\Drivers\Test\Beta
D:\Drivers\Test\Release

```

And so the Visual people
