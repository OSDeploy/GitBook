# Gather Microsoft Updates

The next step is to gather the Microsoft Updates that we want to add to our OSMedia.  Head over to the Microsoft Update Catalog at [https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/home.aspx](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/home.aspx)

In the Search Box, enter 2018-06 Windows 10 1803 x64

This will give us the latest updates \(at the time of writing\) for our Windows 10 Enterprise 1803 x64

Pay attention to the date of the newest Cumulative Update if you have multiple.  You should also download the Adobe Flash Player update.

### Updates Directory

In C:\OSBuild, create a directory called Updates.  Download any Update you need and place into the C:\OSBuild\Updates directory in any logical structure you think is necessary.
